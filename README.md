# Repl hacks

Live coding with PureScript wags in the Repl & in VSCode.

## To run

```
npm install
npm start
```

Then, you can edit the file `Wagged.purs` in the live session. Check out the signature of `Wag` in `Hack.purs` to see what parameters are available, and check out `Audio.purs` to see how things are linked up.
